                <h2>Effortless Sharing with NFC & QR Code Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    Experience seamless networking with your very own virtual business card. Using your NFC-enabled BharatTouch card, you can easily share your professional details in seconds - no app installs or logins required.
                </p>
                <p>Simply tap the card on a smartphone to bring up your profile:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For <b>iPhones</b>, hold the card near the <b>top edge on the back</b>, where the NFC reader is located. </li>
                    <li>For most <b>Android phones</b>, tap the card on the <b>center-back</b> of the device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since metal is not conducive to the NFC (Near Field Communication) radio waves, a window has been provided using a conducive material (as shown in the diagrams). Touching that window of the card to the phone's NFC sensor is important to understand.</p>
                <p>If the other person’s phone doesn’t support NFC, no problem! You can still use the printed QR code on your card. </p>

                <p>Your privacy and control are important. That’s why most sections on BharatTouch include a checkbox labeled "Hide [Section Name]"—allowing you to easily choose which parts of your digital profile remain visible.</p>
                <p>If you prefer not to display certain personal or professional information—such as your education, experience, contact details, or social links—you can check the box next to "Hide [Section Name]" in that section. Your data will still be saved securely in your account, but it won’t be visible to others.</p>
                <p>This feature gives you full flexibility to customize your profile and share only what you feel is relevant.</p.

                <p>Feel free to update visibility anytime—it’s just one click away! </p>
